        Yes, there is a slashing mechanism to help increase reliability and stablability
        for the network. Inoperative and misbehaving nodes in the committee will get
        slashed and be replaced with better nodes. If a node is slashed, the original
        1,750 staked PRV would be returned back to the node operator and they can re-stake
        it at a later time. Also, rewards from slashed nodes will be distributed to
        remaining nodes in a committee
